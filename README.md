# Study Blocker 🙇‍♂️🚫

Built by @blind_nabler

An application designed to block distracting websites to allow you to do your best work.

I built this as a side project because I love working with rust. But I am also building this for my friends that use linux and want a simple GUI tool to manage what sites are blocked and for how long. I used to use SelfControl but it is only available for MacOS, but since I built this with rust and egui this is no longer an issue.
